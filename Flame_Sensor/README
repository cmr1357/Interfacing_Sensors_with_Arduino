# Flame Sensor interfacing With Arduino #

Hi Friends, Today we will be discussing about the flame sensor. 
As the name this little sensors are used to detect fire in a particular range hence can be used in projects like fire alarms.

## Flame sensor Module ##

Flame sensor module has a built-in IR receiver, resistor, capacitor, potentiometer, and comparator LM393 . The built-in potentiometer in the sensor is used to adjust the sensitivity. This module can detect infrared light with a wavelength ranging from 700nm to 1000nm. 

## Working Principle ##

When fire burns it emits a small amount of Infra-red light, this light will be received by the photodiode, which is a high speed and high sensitive NPN silicon phototransistor that can detect infrared light with a wavelength ranging from 700nm to 1000nm and detection angle is about 60 degree. Then the OP-Amp will check for change in voltage across the IR Receiver. If a fire is detected the output pin (D0) will give 0v(LOW), and if no fire the output pin will be 5v.


## Connections ##

1. Connect the VCC of the sensor to 5v of Arduino.
2. Connect GND of the sensor to GND of the Arduino.
3. Aout to analog pin A0.

## Code ##


Please refer to the attached code with the explanation.
