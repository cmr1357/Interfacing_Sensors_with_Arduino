# Interfacing Hall Effect Sensor With Arduino #

Hi Friends, Today we will be discussing the Hall Effect sensor. 
The hall effect sensor can be found in many applications it can be found in vehicles as speed sensor, switches, MEMS Compasses. Proximity Sensors.


Now, What is the hall effect?

Hall effect is the most common method of measuring magnetic field, Consider we have a thin conducting plate and we a battery to it so that current can flow through it.
The charge carries flow straight from one side of the plate to other . When we place a magnetic near the Conducting plate 
It will disturbe the straight flow of current carriers due to a force called Lorance force and the electrongs get deflect in one side and the potrons deflect to the other side
and if we measure the voltage across he plate we will get some measurable voltage from it and the effcect of getting a measurable voltage in this case is called a Hall effect 
and is discovered by Edvin Hall.
There are two types of Hall effect sensor one produce Analog output and the other produce Diggital output.

## IR sensor Module ##

IR sensor module has a built-in IR transmitter and IR receiver. IR transmitter sends IR radiation and the receiver detects the presence of reflected IR energy. The module has a built-in potentiometer to adjust the sensitivity or detection range. The sensor has a very good and stable response even in ambient light or in complete darkness.
The IR sensor module is an active low device Which means the sensor normally outputs a HIGH signal on its signal line when no object is in front of it. When an object comes in front of it, it outputs a LOW signal(0V). 

## Working Principle ##

The Hall effect sensor worked on the principle of Hall effect. The Hall effect sensor produce small hall voltage 
so it is usually manufactured using small build in High gain Amplifier. The Analog sensor composed of High gain Amplifier , a voltage regulator 
The measured Analog voltage is proportional to the Hall volage. 
## Connections ##

1. Connect the VCC of the sensor to VCC of Arduino.
2. Connect GND of the sensor to GND of the Arduino.
3. Connect the output pin of the sensor module to pin 3 of the Arduino board.
4. Connect another LED to pin 13 of Arduino to see the output.
